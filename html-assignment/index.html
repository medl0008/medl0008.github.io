      <article><h1>About Me</h1></article>
      <p>My name is Jay Medland and I am a 22 year-old student originally from Barrie, Ontario. I recently graduated
        from Western University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Media, Information & Technoculture (<em>yes,
        that is a real word</em>). I chose to join Algonquin College's Interactive Media Design program with the 
        hopes of receiving more practical skills in media production, given my program at Western largely focused on
        theory rather than applicable skills in development. I have no regrets spending my time studying these
        theories and expanding my mind in the artistic, socio-political, and economic implications of media, however,
        to feed my creative drive, I would like to learn how to produce content, rather than simply analyze it.
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to media development and production, my dream job is to be involved in digital content and art
        curation. Ideally, this would be in the music industry, whether it is curating an artists' social media posts,
        developing promotional material for album cycles, editing and directing music videos, and being involved in all
        creative elements that produce a musician as a brand to be consumed by their audience. Music-wise, I am
        enthralled with the electric and eccentric stylings of pop music, from the dancey-bubblegum beats, to the
        over-the-top outfits and stage design, and the limitless stretch of boundary that pop music offers sonically and
        visually. My personal favourite artist is singer-songwriter-rapper <b>Kesha</b>, who has sold over 143 million records worldwide
        and is known for her outrageous and glittery image, as well as her feminist and queer-friendly approach both lyrically
        and politically. She boasts over 45 million followers across platforms, with 2 #1 albums, 4 #1 singles, and over 10 multi-platinum
        hits in the US. She has inspired me in so many ways and it would be a dream to work with her in any sense, or to 
        interview, style, or photograph her.
